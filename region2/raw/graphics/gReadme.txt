Fortress Defense Graphics - thanks to kzel and dead for creating most of them! Also thanks to YetAnotherLurker for fixing the offset bug and consolidating the corrected files into one!

IMPORTANT: These graphics are ONLY for basic mode races. Challenge mode races do not yet have sprites!

Copy all the image and text files from this folder except this one into the "graphics" directory in the raws. Make sure this is done for any desired active saves. Once the game is started up, assuming the init option for graphics is turned to yes, the graphics should work.
